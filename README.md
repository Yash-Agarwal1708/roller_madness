# Roller Madness
Roller Madness Game made in unity  
This is a game i made using unity. To run the game-go to builds->windows->rollermadness (application).  
This game has 2 levels, to clear level 1 score 20 points. Yellow coins are worth 1 point, blue ones are 5 points. Avoid the red boxes as they are enemy, if you collide with them twice it's game over.  
Hope you have fun playing.  
I implemented the chaser function which makes the enemy lock down on the player and chase it throughout the level. I also implemented random enemy spanwner and coin generation.
