# Roller Madness
Roller Madness Game made in unity  
This is a game I made using Unity. To run the game-go to builds->windows->rollermadness (application).  
This game has two levels. To clear level 1, score 20 points. Yellow coins are worth 1 point, and blue ones are 5 points. Avoid the red boxes, as they are enemies. If you collide with them twice, it's game over.  
Hope you have fun playing.  
I implemented the chaser function, which makes the enemy lock down on the player and chase it throughout the level. I also implemented random enemy spawners and coin generation.
